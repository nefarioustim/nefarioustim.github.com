## Fit for use

*   [Modern Carousel][modern-carousel]

    A carousel widget for jQuery that makes use of modern CSS to keep panels
    within the normal flow of the document. This means there are no positional
    calculations required in the JavaScript, and no float clearing is required
    in the CSS.
    
    This carousel is untested and unsupported in older browsers, including
    Internet Explorer 6.
    
*   [jQuery Accordion][jquery-accordion]

    A fully customisable accordion widget for jQuery.
    
    Gets around the jumping issues with jQuery's `slideDown` method by not
    using it. Also fixes known issues with jQuery's opacity filter in IE6 and
    IE7.
