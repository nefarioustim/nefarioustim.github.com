*   ## <span>&minus;</span> Fit for use

    *   ###[Modern Carousel][modern-carousel]

        A carousel widget for jQuery that makes use of modern CSS to keep
        panels within the normal flow of the document. This means there are no
        positional calculations required in the JavaScript, and no float
        clearing in the CSS.
    
        This carousel is unsupported, and therefore untested, in older
        browsers, including Internet Explorer 6.
    
    *   ###[jQuery Accordion][jquery-accordion]

        A fully customisable accordion widget for jQuery.
    
        Gets around the jumping issues with jQuery's `slideDown` method by not
        using it. Also fixes known issues with jQuery's opacity filter in IE6
        and IE7.
